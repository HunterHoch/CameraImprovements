This repository gives insight on how to properly add depth of field (DoF) to the in-game view camera in FiveM using native functions. DoF can greatly enhance the overall look and feel of the game. There are comments on each line explains the basic usage/good coding practices and provides an example command that shows how to use the relevant native functions to achieve the desired effect. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this can help you create better-looking cameras in FiveM.
